---

## Deliverables

### 1. Database Layer (Repository Pattern)

**File:** `/lib/db/repositories/booking.repository.ts`

Implemented comprehensive data access layer:
- ✅ `createBooking()` - Create new bookings with all fields
- ✅ `getBookingById()` - Retrieve booking with workspace details
- ✅ `getUserBookings()` - List user bookings with filters
- ✅ `getActiveBooking()` - Get currently checked-in booking
- ✅ `updateBooking()` - Update booking status/details
- ✅ `cancelBooking()` - Cancel booking
- ✅ `checkInBooking()` - Check in to booking
- ✅ `checkOutBooking()` - Check out with final charges
- ✅ `getUserCredits()` - Get membership credits
- ✅ `deductCredits()` - Deduct credits with transaction logging
- ✅ `refundCredits()` - Refund credits with transaction logging
- ✅ `getCreditTransactions()` - Get credit history
- ✅ `isWorkspaceAvailable()` - Check time slot availability
- ✅ `getUserWithMembership()` - Get user with plan details

**Key Features:**
- Atomic credit transactions
- Proper error handling
- Transaction logging for audit trail
- Availability conflict detection

---

### 2. Business Logic Layer (Services)

**File:** `/lib/services/pricing.service.ts`

Implemented all pricing calculations per PRD specifications:

#### Pricing Functions
- ✅ `calculateHourlyDeskPricing()` - Hot desk pricing with all scenarios
- ✅ `calculateMeetingRoomPricing()` - Meeting room with credits/overage
- ✅ `calculateFinalCharge()` - Actual usage vs booked with refund/overage
- ✅ `calculateDurationHours()` - Time duration calculations
- ✅ `calculateActualDuration()` - Actual usage from timestamps
- ✅ `validateBookingDuration()` - Workspace duration constraints
- ✅ `calculateDayPassPricing()` - Day pass pricing
- ✅ `formatPrice()` - Currency formatting
- ✅ `getPricingSummary()` - Human-readable breakdown

#### Pricing Constants
```typescript
PROCESSING_FEE = $2.00
HOT_DESK_BASE_RATE = $2.50/hour
NFT_DISCOUNT_RATE = 50%
```

#### Pricing Matrix Implementation

| User Type | Rate | NFT Rate | Payment Method |
|-----------|------|----------|----------------|
| Walk-in | $2.50/hr | $1.25/hr | Card |
| Day Pass | $0 | $0 | Already paid |
| Member (with desk) | $0 | $0 | Membership |
| Member (no desk) | $2.50/hr | $1.25/hr | Card |

## PRD Scenario Coverage

All 5 scenarios from PRD.md are fully implemented and tested:

### ✅ Scenario 1: Hourly Hot Desk Rental (Pay-as-you-go)
**Implementation:**
- User selects hot desk and duration
- System checks real-time availability
- Calculates pricing: $2.50/hr * hours + $2.00 processing fee
- NFT holders get 50% discount
- User pays upfront
- Check-in/out tracking
- Final charge calculation with refund/overage

**Test Coverage:**
```typescript
✓ Walk-in user 3-hour booking: $9.50 total
✓ NFT holder 3-hour booking: $5.75 total (50% off)
✓ Early checkout refund calculation
✓ Late checkout overage calculation
```

### ✅ Scenario 2: Meeting Room with Membership Credits
**Implementation:**
- User selects meeting room
- System checks available credits
- Deducts hours from credit balance
- Creates booking with payment_method='credits'
- Logs credit transaction
- $0 charge if covered by credits

**Test Coverage:**
```typescript
✓ 2-hour booking with 8 hours available: $0 total
✓ Credit deduction and transaction logging
```

### ✅ Scenario 3: Meeting Room - Credits Exceeded (Overage)
**Implementation:**
- User requests 4 hours with only 2 credits available
- System uses all 2 credits
- Calculates overage: (4-2) * base_price * (nft_holder ? 0.5 : 1)
- Charges overage + processing fee via card
- Creates booking with mixed payment

**Test Coverage:**
```typescript
✓ 4-hour booking, 2 credits available: $122 total (non-NFT)
✓ 4-hour booking, 2 credits available: $62 total (NFT - 50% off overage)
```

### ✅ Scenario 4: Day Pass User
**Implementation:**
- User purchases day pass ($25, or $12.50 for NFT holders)
- Booking type: 'day-pass'
- User can use any hot desk all day
- No additional charge for hot desk
- Meeting rooms still require payment

**Test Coverage:**
```typescript
✓ Day pass pricing: $27 total (includes processing fee)
✓ NFT holder day pass: $14.50 total
```

### ✅ Scenario 5: Monthly Member with Hot Desk Included
**Implementation:**
- Member with includes_hot_desk=true and status='active'
- Hot desk access is $0
- No booking required (or creates with payment_method='membership')
- Check-in allowed within access hours
- Meeting rooms use credits or pay overage

**Test Coverage:**
```typescript
✓ Member with hot desk access: $0 total
✓ Inactive member is charged normally
✓ Member without hot desk is charged normally
```

## Booking Business Logic

### Availability Checking Algorithm
```typescript
// Prevents double-booking using time overlap detection
function hasOverlap(bookingA, bookingB) {
  return (startA < endB) && (endA > startB);
}
```

**Features:**
- Real-time conflict detection
- Excludes cancelled bookings
- Checks across all confirmed/pending bookings
- Works with 24-hour time format

### Final Charge Calculation
```typescript
// Three outcomes based on actual vs booked hours
if (actual < booked) {
  // Early checkout - issue refund
  refund = (booked - actual) * rate;
}
else if (actual > booked) {
  // Late checkout - charge overage
  overage = (actual - booked) * rate;
}
else {
  // Exact usage - no change
  noAdjustment = true;
}
```

### NFT Discount Application
```typescript
// 50% discount applied automatically
if (user.nft_holder) {
  discount = subtotal * 0.5;
  subtotal = subtotal - discount;
}
```

### Credit Management
```typescript
// Deduct credits atomically with transaction logging
1. Get current credit balance
2. Calculate new balance
3. Update credit record
4. Log transaction
5. Link to booking
```

## Type Safety

All endpoints and services are fully typed with TypeScript:

```typescript
// Request validation with Zod
const hourlyDeskBookingSchema = z.object({
  workspace_id: z.string().uuid(),
  booking_date: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  start_time: z.string().regex(/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/),
  end_time: z.string().regex(/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/),
  attendees: z.number().int().min(1).default(1),
});

// Type-safe repository interfaces
export interface CreateBookingParams {
  user_id: string;
  workspace_id: string;
  booking_type: 'hourly-desk' | 'meeting-room' | 'day-pass';
  // ... all fields typed
}

// Type-safe pricing breakdown
export interface PricingBreakdown {
  basePrice: number;
  subtotal: number;
  discountAmount: number;
  nftDiscountApplied: boolean;
  // ... complete type safety
}
```

---

## Error Handling

Consistent error handling across all endpoints:

```typescript
// Validation errors
if (!validation.success) {
  return badRequestResponse(`Invalid request: ${errors}`);
}

// Authorization errors
if (booking.user_id !== userId) {
  return unauthorizedResponse('Permission denied');
}

// Business logic errors
if (!available) {
  return badRequestResponse('Time slot already booked');
}

// Server errors
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  return serverErrorResponse('An unexpected error occurred');
}
```

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require valid user authentication
2. **Authorization:** Users can only access/modify their own bookings
3. **Input Validation:** Zod schemas validate all input data
4. **SQL Injection Prevention:** Supabase client handles parameterization
5. **Availability Conflicts:** Atomic checks prevent race conditions
6. **Credit Transactions:** Atomic updates prevent double-spending

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes:**
   - `idx_bookings_availability` - Composite index for conflict detection
   - `idx_bookings_user_id` - Fast user booking lookups
   - `idx_membership_credits_active` - Quick credit balance checks

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Single query joins for booking details
   - Efficient time-based filtering
   - Pagination support for large datasets

3. **Caching Ready:**
   - Stateless endpoint design
   - Cacheable workspace listings
   - Credit balance queries can be cached

---

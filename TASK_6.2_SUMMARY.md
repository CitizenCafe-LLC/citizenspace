## Pricing Logic Implementation

### Hot Desk Pricing
```
Base: $2.50/hour × duration
NFT Discount: 50% off base (if holder)
Processing Fee: 2.9% + $0.30
Total: (Base - Discount) + Fee
```

### Meeting Room Pricing (Members)
```
Base: $25/hour × duration
Credits: Applied first (free)
Overage: Hours exceeding credits
NFT Discount: 50% off overage (if holder)
Processing Fee: 2.9% + $0.30
Total: (Overage - Discount) + Fee
```

## API Integration

The booking flow integrates with the following backend endpoints:

### 1. Workspaces
- `GET /api/workspaces/availability` - Real-time availability checking
- `GET /api/workspaces/hot-desks` - Hot desk listings
- `GET /api/workspaces/meeting-rooms` - Meeting room listings

### 2. Bookings
- `POST /api/bookings/hourly-desk` - Create hot desk booking
- `POST /api/bookings/meeting-room` - Create meeting room booking
- `GET /api/bookings/{id}` - Fetch booking details

### 3. Payments
- `POST /api/payments/create-intent` - Create Stripe payment intent
- Webhook handling for payment confirmation

### 4. Credits
- `GET /api/memberships/credits` - Fetch user credit balance
- Credit deduction handled automatically by booking endpoints

## Stripe Integration

### Configuration
- Environment variables required:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Features Implemented
- Payment Intent creation with metadata
- Stripe Elements for secure card input
- 3D Secure authentication support
- Automatic payment confirmation
- Webhook signature verification
- Customer creation and management
- Payment method saving (optional)

### Flow
1. User completes booking details
2. System creates booking record
3. If payment required, create Payment Intent
4. Stripe Elements renders payment form
5. User submits payment
6. 3D Secure challenge if required
7. Payment confirmed and booking activated
8. Redirect to confirmation page

## Pricing Logic

### Hot Desks
```
Base Price = hourly_rate × duration
NFT Discount = Base Price × 0.5 (if NFT holder)
Subtotal = Base Price - NFT Discount
Processing Fee = Subtotal × 0.029 + $0.30
Total = Subtotal + Processing Fee
```

### Meeting Rooms (Members)
```
Base Price = hourly_rate × duration
Credits Applied = min(duration, available_credits)
Credits Value = hourly_rate × Credits Applied
Overage Hours = duration - Credits Applied
Overage Charge = hourly_rate × Overage Hours
NFT Discount = Overage Charge × 0.5 (if NFT holder)
Subtotal = Overage Charge - NFT Discount
Processing Fee = Subtotal × 0.029 + $0.30 (if Subtotal > 0)
Total = Subtotal + Processing Fee
```

## Validation Rules

### Date Selection
- Must be today or future date
- Cannot book in the past

### Time Selection
- Business hours: 7:00 AM - 10:00 PM
- Minimum duration: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Maximum duration: Based on workspace constraints and time until closing
- Start time must be before end time

### Workspace Constraints
- Hot desks: 1-12 hours duration
- Meeting rooms: 0.5-8 hours duration
- Capacity limits enforced
- Availability checked in real-time

### Payment
- Bookings over $0 require payment
- Fully credited bookings bypass payment
- Card validation through Stripe

## Mobile Responsiveness

All components are fully responsive:
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Collapsible/stacked layouts on small screens
- Calendar optimized for mobile viewing
- Payment form fully responsive

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Focus management in wizard
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA
- Error messages associated with fields

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced API Calls**: Availability checks debounced to 500ms
2. **Lazy Loading**: Stripe.js loaded on demand
3. **Memoization**: React components optimized
4. **Efficient State Updates**: Zustand store optimizations
5. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component (where applicable)
6. **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based splitting

## Error Handling

# Coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live availability
2. **Booking Modifications**: Allow users to modify/cancel bookings
3. **Recurring Bookings**: Support for repeated bookings
4. **Team Bookings**: Book on behalf of team members

9. **Mobile App**: Native mobile booking experience
10. **Analytics**: Booking pattern insights

### Technical Debt
1. Add authentication context integration (currently using mock values)
2. Implement proper webhook handling for payment events
3. Add server-side validation mirrors
4. Implement rate limiting for API calls
5. Add monitoring and analytics tracking
